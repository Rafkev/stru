Implementation of a Trie data structure in Python...
TrieNode represents a single node in the Trie. It contains a dictionary of children nodes and a boolean flag indicating whether the node represents the end of a word.
Trie is the main Trie data structure. It has methods for inserting a word into the Trie, searching for a word in the Trie, and checking if a word starts with a given prefix.
Example usage demonstrates how to use the Trie class to insert words into the Trie and perform searches and prefix checks.
